Dogs _can_ look up!

**dog** is a command-line DNS client, like `dig`.
It has colourful output, understands normal command-line argument syntax, supports the DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS protocols, and can emit JSON.

## Examples

    dog example.net                          Query a domain using default settings
    dog example.net MX                       ...looking up MX records instead
    dog example.net MX @1.1.1.1              ...using a specific nameserver instead
    dog example.net MX @1.1.1.1 -T           ...using TCP rather than UDP
    dog -q example.net -t MX -n 1.1.1.1 -T   As above, but using explicit arguments

## Command-line options

### Query options

    <arguments>              Human-readable host names, nameservers, types, or classes
    -q, --query=HOST         Host name or domain name to query
    -t, --type=TYPE          Type of the DNS record being queried (A, MX, NS...)
    -n, --nameserver=ADDR    Address of the nameserver to send packets to
    --class=CLASS            Network class of the DNS record being queried (IN, CH, HS)

### Sending options

    --edns=SETTING           Whether to OPT in to EDNS (disable, hide, show)
    --txid=NUMBER            Set the transaction ID to a specific value
    -Z=TWEAKS                Set uncommon protocol-level tweaks

### Protocol options

    -U, --udp                Use the DNS protocol over UDP
    -T, --tcp                Use the DNS protocol over TCP
    -S, --tls                Use the DNS-over-TLS protocol
    -H, --https              Use the DNS-over-HTTPS protocol

### Output options

    -1, --short              Short mode: display nothing but the first result
    -J, --json               Display the output as JSON
    --color, --colour=WHEN   When to colourise the output (always, automatic, never)
    --seconds                Do not format durations, display them as seconds
    --time                   Print how long the response took to arrive

## Installation

To install dog, you can download a pre-compiled binary, or you can compile it from source. You _may_ be able to install dog using your OS’s package manager, depending on your platform.


### Packages

- For Arch Linux, install the [`dog`](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/dog/) package.
- For Homebrew on macOS, install the [`dog`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/dog) formula.
- For NixOS, install the [`dogdns`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=dogdns&query=dogdns) package.


### Downloads

Binary downloads of dog are available from [the releases section on GitHub](https://github.com/ogham/dog/releases/) for 64-bit Windows, macOS, and Linux targets. They contain the compiled executable, the manual page, and shell completions.


### Compilation

dog is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
You will need rustc version 1.87 or higher; the recommended way to install Rust is from the [official download page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), using rustup.

DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS use the system’s TLS library: OpenSSL on Linux, linked dynamically, so dog picks up the distribution’s security updates.
On Debian or Ubuntu, install the build dependencies with:

    $ sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev

Then download the source code and run:

    $ cargo build --release
    $ cargo test --workspace

- Copy the resulting binary, which will be in the `target/release` directory, into a folder in your `$PATH`.
`/usr/local/bin` is usually a good choice.

- The [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner can be used to run some helpful development commands, in a manner similar to `make`.
Run `just --list` to get an overview of what’s available.

- To compile and install the manual pages, you will need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
The `just man` command will compile the Markdown into manual pages, which it will place in the `target/man` directory.
To use them, copy them into a directory that `man` will read.
`/usr/local/share/man` is usually a good choice.


### Container image

To build the container image of dog, you can use Docker or Kaniko. Here an example using Docker:

    $ docker build -t dog .

The image runs on the current Debian stable. You can then run it using the following command:

    $ docker run -it --rm dog

To run dog directly, you can then define the following alias:

    $ alias dog="docker run -it --rm dog"


### Testing

`just test` (or `cargo test --workspace`, with and without `--no-default-features`) runs the unit tests and the end-to-end tests.
The end-to-end tests run the real dog binary against loopback servers that replay responses captured from real nameservers, so they never touch the internet.

- `just bless` rewrites the golden output files in `tests/golden/` after a deliberate change to dog’s output; review the diff before keeping it.
- `just capture-fixtures` re-captures the responses in `tests/fixtures/` from public servers and a local BIND container (it needs `dig` and `docker`).
- `just test-live` runs the tests that query real public servers.
- `just coverage` measures line coverage with [cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov), and `just complexity` checks every function’s cyclomatic complexity with [lizard](https://github.com/terryyin/lizard).
- `just verify` runs all of the above checks.

dog also has an older extended test suite written as [Specsheet](https://specsheet.software/) check documents.
If you have a copy installed, you can run it with `just xtests`.
It makes DNS requests over the network, which will expose your IP address.
For more information, read [the xtests README](xtests/README.md).


### Feature toggles

dog has three Cargo features that can be switched off to remove functionality.
While doing so makes dog less useful, it results in a smaller binary that takes less time to build, and one that does not need a TLS library.

There are three feature toggles available, all of which are active by default:

- `with_idna`, which enables [IDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name) processing
- `with_tls`, which enables DNS-over-TLS
- `with_https`, which enables DNS-over-HTTPS

Use `cargo` to build a binary that uses feature toggles. For example, to disable TLS and HTTPS support but keep IDNA support enabled, you can run:

    $ cargo build --no-default-features --features=with_idna

The list of features that have been disabled can be checked at runtime as part of the `--version` string.
